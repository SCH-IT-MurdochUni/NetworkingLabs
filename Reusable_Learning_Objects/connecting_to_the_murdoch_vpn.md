To connect to the murdoch VPN you will have to be a member enrolled in one of the following units:

**ICT291, ICT302, ICT369, ICT372, ICT535, ICT611 or added by a staff member.**

## Setting up Azure multi-factor authentication:

Before you can start using Murdoch's Cisco AnyConnect VPN service the Azure Multi-factor Authentication(MFA) component for your Murdoch AD account must be configured.

To configure your Azure MFA, go to https://aka.ms/mfasetup and login with your Murdoch staff/student number and password. 

![mfalogin](../IMGs/Mfalogin.jpg?raw=true "MFA Login")

You will be asked to supply more information to keep your account secure - click Next to proceed.

At **Step 1** you will be asked to select a default verification method and given the options of Authentication phone, Office phone or **Mobile app**.

Please select **Mobile App** and then check the **Receive notifications for verification option**

![mfasetup](../IMGs/MFA_5AdditionalSecurityVerification_MobileApp.png?raw=true "MFA setup")

The Office phone method is not supported, and the Authentication phone method is not recommended

Proceed by clicking Set up - you will then be prompted to set up the Microsoft Authenticator App on your smart phone



## Install the Microsoft Authenticator App:

Microsoft Authenticator is required to validate your credentials via your smart phone. To install this app search for Microsoft Authenticator in the App Store or Google Play and click install 

![msauth](../IMGs/msauth.png "Microsoft Authenticator")

The app will prompt you to scan a QR code to complete setup. Using another computer, log in to https://aka.ms/mfasetup as per the Azure MFA Setup step, and click **Set up Authenticator app**

Scan the QR code or enter the 6 digit code and Microsoft Authenticator will complete setup

Without access to your secondary verification option, VPN access will not be possible.

**Q: Can I change my additional security verification option?**

Yes, but this requires access to your existing security verification option. If you no longer have access to this, you will need to contact the IT Service Desk for assistance

**Q: I previously had access to custom VPN profiles, how do I access these?**

You will need to contact the IT Service Desk for custom instructions.

**Q: I have been using an alternate VPN client to connect, will I need to use AnyConnect with MFA?**

Yes, other client access will stop working when the old VPN servers are retired so AnyConnect will be required.

**Q: Do I need to install the Microsoft Authenticator App if I elect to receive my verification code by SMS?**

No, however reliance on SMS/text code can be an issue if you are in an area with poor mobile reception.
