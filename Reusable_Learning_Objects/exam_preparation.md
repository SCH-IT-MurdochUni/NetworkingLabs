Wher preparing for you exams, you are hopefully starting froma a position of having completed all the lab exercises, and having gone through all the content presented within the unit. After this, you should look for any sample or practice papers that have been provided by the unit coordinator.

As you study for your exams please also make sure that you take care of your whole self or well-being. This includes eating healthy food, whatever that means to you, doing what you can to get in some daily physical activity, and ensuring that you are getting to bed at a consisent time and meeting your sleep targets. 

One of the most important things that you can do is to eep your mind focused. The i [Pomodoro technique] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

Generating question sets can be a good way to stay focused. Reading linearly through a text book, that may have been desgigned as a reference book may be problematic. 

To generate question sets, you can use your favourite AI tool, and perhaps should experiment with different types. You should starty by trying to generate question sets based on the unit description, learning outcomes and assessment descriptinos found on the handbook. 

Here is a sample prompt:

```
Generate me written/multi choice questions based on a university unit with the following unit description, learning outcomes and assessments. I am preparing for a final exam, so don't give me the answers until I ask for one.

...[insert unit descriptinos here]....
```

## Critiquing AI ##

One of the issues is that you may not know if the generative AI tool that you are using is correct. Remember that you are not aiming for memorisation, you are aiming for understanding. If you you have to wrote memorise something then you may not understand it. If you understand the topic really well, you likely won't have to be trying to wrote memoris much. 

Try to get as [Socratic in the way that you question and quiz AI] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning). Keep asking it questions and be thoughtful about material being presented to you. If you are uncertain and after some effort, cannot be confident in your knowledge, please share your query in the unit Teams site so that the topic can be discussed with the teaching staff and yoru fellow tutors. 

## Common Exam Mistakes ##

I commonly see students:
* Failing to carufully read the question
* Telling me everything they know about the topic, rather than asking the question.
