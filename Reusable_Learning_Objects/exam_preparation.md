Wher preparing for you exams, you are hopefully starting froma a position of having completed all the lab exercises, and having gone through all the content presented within the unit. After this, you should look for any sample or practice papers that have been provided by the unit coordinator.

As you study for your exams please also make sure that you take care of your whole self or well-being. This includes eating healthy food, whatever that means to you, doing what you can to get in some daily physical activity, and ensuring that you are getting to bed at a consisent time and meeting your sleep targets. 

One of the most important things that you can do is to eep your mind focused. The [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a common method that you can use to stay focused. Another method is to generating question sets, or problems for you to work on. This can be a good way to stay focused as reading linearly through a text book, that may have been desgigned as a reference book may be problematic. 

## Generating Quesiton Sets with AI ##

To generate question sets, you can use your favourite AI tool, and perhaps should experiment with different types. You should starty by trying to generate question sets based on the unit description, learning outcomes and assessment descriptinos found on the handbook. 

Here is a sample prompt:

```
Generate me written/multi choice questions based on a university unit with the following unit description, 
learning outcomes and assessments. I am preparing for a final exam, so don't give me the answers until 
I ask for one.

...[insert unit description and learning outcomes here]....

```

Obviously you can be far more targeted about your weaknesses or areas where you know that you may recieve questions. Asking for detailed problem sets, around subnetting, sample programiming problems, are all prompts that you can engineer. Try to think of AI as an always on study partner, but one whose work needs checking. 

## Critiquing AI ##

One of the issues is that you may not know if the generative AI tool that you are using is correct. Remember that you are not aiming for memorisation, you are aiming for understanding. If you you have to wrote memorise something then you may not understand it. If you understand the topic really well, you likely won't have to be trying to wrote memoris much. 

Try to get as [Socratic in the way that you question and quiz AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning). Keep asking it questions and be thoughtful about material being presented to you. If you are uncertain and after some effort, cannot be confident in your knowledge, please share your query in the unit Teams site so that the topic can be discussed with the teaching staff and yoru fellow tutors. 

## Common Exam Mistakes ##

These are some common mistakes I see students making.
* Failing to carefully read the question
* Telling me everything they know about the topic, rather than answering the question
