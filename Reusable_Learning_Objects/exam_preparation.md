When preparing for your exams, start by completing all the lab exercises and reviewing the content presented within the unit. After this, look for any sample or practice papers provided by the unit coordinator.

### Well-being During Study ###

As you study, take care of your overall well-being. This includes eating healthy food, engaging in daily physical activity, and ensuring you get enough sleep by going to bed at a consistent time. Setting an alarm clock to tell you to got to bed and keeping this consistent is more important than setting an alarm clock to wake you up to study when you are sleep deprived and stressed. 

### Staying Focused ###
One of the most important things you can do is keep your mind focused. Here are some additional tips to help you stay focused:

* [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique): Use this common method to stay focused by working in short, timed intervals with breaks in between.
* Minimize Distractions: Find a quiet study space, turn off notifications on your devices, and set specific study times to create a routine.
* Set Goals: Break your study sessions into manageable goals and reward yourself when you achieve them.
* Stay Organized: Keep your study materials and notes organized to avoid wasting time looking for information.
* Generating Question Sets: Create question sets or problems to work on. This can be more effective than reading linearly through a textbook designed as a reference book.

### Generating Question Sets with AI ###

To generate question sets, use your favorite AI tool and experiment with different types. Start by generating question sets based on the unit description, learning outcomes, and assessment descriptions found in the handbook. Here is a sample prompt:

```
Generate written/multiple-choice questions based on a university unit with the following unit description, 
learning outcomes, and assessments. I am preparing for a final exam, so don't give me the answers until 
I ask for them.

[insert unit description and learning outcomes here]
```

You can be more targeted about your weaknesses or areas where you expect questions. Asking for detailed problem sets around specific topics can be helpful. Think of AI as an always-on study partner, but remember to check its work.

### Critiquing AI ###

You may not know if the generative AI tool you are using is correct. Your goal is understanding, not memorization. If you understand the topic well, you likely won't need to memorize much. Be [Socratic in your questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning) and quizzing of AI. If you are uncertain, share your query on the unit Teams site for discussion with teaching staff and fellow tutors.

Critiquing AI and drilling down into why the Generative AI algorithm may be providing a reponse will strengthen your written communication skills as well as your critical thinking skills.

### Common Exam Mistakes ###

Here are some common mistakes students make during exams:

* Failing to carefully read the question.
* Describing everything they know about the topic, rather than answering the question.
* Poor Time Management: Spending too much time on one question and not leaving enough time for others.
* Ignoring Instructions: Not following specific instructions given in the exam, such as word limits or format requirements.
