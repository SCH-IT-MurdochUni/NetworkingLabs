## Scenario 2 ##

Ann works for your food company. It is suspected that she is a mole and is working for a competing company. Ann has access to the secret recipe, which is the company’s prize asset. Security staff are worried that Ann may leak the company’s secret recipe.

As the forensic investigator, your mission is to figure out who Ann is communicating with and work out what happened.

Questions to answer:
* Who is Ann talking to?
* What protocol and application are they using to communicate?
* What is the secret recipe and how was it leaked?
* What is Ann's IP address?
* What is Ann's MAC address and what vendor built her PC?
